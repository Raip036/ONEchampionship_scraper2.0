# ONE Championship Fighter Scraper

This project is a **web scraper** built with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to collect fighter statistics from the [ONE Championship website](https://www.onefc.com/athletes/).  
It navigates through paginated fighter listings, follows each fighter profile, and extracts stats like:

- **Name**
- **Wins**
- **Losses**
- **KO Wins** (from fight history if standard records are missing)

The scraped data is stored in a CSV file (`fighters.csv`) for analysis or integration into other projects (e.g., predictive analytics, dashboards, data science projects).

---

## üöÄ Features
- Scrapes all fighters across multiple pages automatically.
- Extracts records from both:
  - Fighter profile stats (when available).
  - Fight history table (fallback when profile stats missing).
- Tallies KO wins by scanning fight history rows.
- Saves clean structured data into a CSV file.
